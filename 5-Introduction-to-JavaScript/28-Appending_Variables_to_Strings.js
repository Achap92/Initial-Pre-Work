/*Much like building strings over multiple lines we can append variables
to a string using the += operator.*/
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "awesome";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
