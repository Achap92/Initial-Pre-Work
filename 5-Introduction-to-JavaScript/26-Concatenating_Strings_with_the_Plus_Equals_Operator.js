/*Used the += operator to concatenate strings together. Note that concatenation
does not add the spaces for proper sentence structure, I need to add them
myself.*/
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
