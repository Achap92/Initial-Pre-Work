/*Learned how to quote strings with single quotes. This is helpful when wanting
to avoid using escape characters so that you can use both types of quotation
marks in a string. Be careful to not add another single quote in the middle
or JavaScript will think that is the end of the quote and will throw an error
in that case you would need to place the escape character in the quote.*/
