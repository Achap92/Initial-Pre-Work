/*Used the % operator to find the remainder of the division of two numbers.
In mathmatics we can check to see if a number is even or odd by dividing that
number by 2 where if the remainder is = to 1 then the number is odd and if
the remainder is = to 0 then the number is even. This however does not work
properly with negative numbers. */
// Only change code below this line

var remainder = 11 % 3;
