/*When you create variables in JavaScript they have an inital value of
undefined so that if we try to do mathmatical operations on an undefined variable
we will get errors such as NaN(Not a Number) or "undefined" if we try to
concatenate a string with an undefined variable.*/
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
