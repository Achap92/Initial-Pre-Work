/*Learned to use the backslash symbol in front of a quote that is inside
quotation marks to tell JavaScript that I want to use a quote inside of a quote.
Doing this tells JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string
but should appear inside the string.*/
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
