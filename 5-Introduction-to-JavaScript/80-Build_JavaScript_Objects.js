/*Created objects in Javascript. Objects are similar to arrays only instead
of using indexes to access the data you use properties. This is useful for storing
data in a structured way can sometimes represent real world objects.*/
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  name: "Bandit",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ["Everyone!"]
};
